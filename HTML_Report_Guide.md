- Win-now strategies are viable (trade picks for proven players)
- Playoff bonus is MASSIVE (100 points can overcome huge value losses)

### **Best Trade of 2025:**

**7RockFire** (August 1, 2025)
- **Sent:** DK Metcalf
- **Acquired:** Jalen Royals + 2026 1st + 2027 2nd
- **Net gain:** +3,444

**Why This Was Brilliant:**
- Sold Metcalf at peak (pre-Geno Smith uncertainty)
- Acquired rookie WR upside (Royals)
- Got TWO premium picks
- Perfect sell-high, buy-low timing

---

### **Worst Trade of 2025:**

**UoohMama** (November 3, 2025)
- **Sent:** Tyrone Tracy + 2026 2nd + 2027 1st  
- **Acquired:** Bucky Irving
- **Net loss:** Immediate -1,319, worsened to -2,586 currently

**Why This Bombed:**
- Overpaid for unproven rookie (Bucky)
- Gave away Tyrone Tracy right before he broke out
- Lost premium draft capital
- Both execution AND outcome were bad

---

### **Fleece Award: Dzel45**

**Dzel45** (November 12, 2025)
- **Sent:** George Kittle (aging TE, 32 years old)
- **Acquired:** 2026 1st round pick
- **At trade:** +1,797
- **Current:** +3,196 (+77% appreciation!)

**Why This Is the Fleece:**
- Sold Kittle before age/injury tanked his value
- Acquired 2026 1st which appreciated with rookie hype
- Classic arbitrage: depreciating → appreciating asset

---

## 📊 League-Wide Insights

### **1. Market Correction Year**
- League net value: **-270,801**
- Only 3 of 14 teams gained value
- This indicates:
  - Inflated auction prices OR
  - 2025 rookie class underwhelmed OR
  - Key injuries tanked asset values

### **2. Playoff Bonus Dominates**
- Top 6 all made playoffs
- All had 8-9 wins
- Playoff bonus > all other factors combined

### **3. Thin Trade Market**
- 11 trades vs. 478 waiver/FA moves (1:43 ratio!)
- More than half the league didn't trade
- Suggests: valuations don't align OR managers are risk-averse

### **4. Trade Activity ≠ Success**
- MaliciousKid: 0 trades, 5th place (playoffs)
- MellowMorello: 4 trades, 6th place, -53K value
- No correlation between trading and GMOTY ranking

### **5. Future Draft Capital is Currency**
- 17 picks traded (mostly 2026-2027 1sts)
- Teams are polarizing: all-in OR rebuild
- 2026 draft will be CRITICAL
