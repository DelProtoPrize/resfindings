# SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES (SCF) ANALYSIS
## Materialism and Delayed Marriage Among Young Adults

**Research Question:** To what extent is the relative strength of materialistic values associated with delayed marital timing, and how do these associations differ across demographic and economic subgroups?

**Data Source:** Survey of Consumer Finances (Federal Reserve Board)  
**Waves:** 2019 + 2022 (pooled)  
**Sample:** Young adults ages 18-29 (~2,000 respondents)  

---

## 📊 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### **Research Design:**

**Type:** Secondary data analysis (cross-sectional)  
**Outcome:** Current marital status (binary)  
**Key Predictor:** Materialism index (composite of behavioral proxies)  
**Controls:** Age, income, education, race/ethnicity, children  

### **Four Investigative Narratives:**

1. **Materialistic Values:** Consumer debt, possessions indicate value priorities
2. **Capstone Marriage:** Education, income, assets indicate "readiness" for marriage
3. **Economic Stress:** Debt burden, financial instability delay marriage
4. **Relational Transactionalism:** Assortative mating on SES

## 🔑 KEY VARIABLES

### **From SCF Codebook:**

**Dependent Variable:**
- `MARRIED` - Current marital status (1=married, 0=not married)
- Derived: `married_by_25`, `married_by_27` (for those old enough)

**Materialism Index Components:**
- `CCBAL` - Credit card balance ($)
- `INSTALL` - Installment debt ($) - auto loans, furniture, appliances
- `VEHIC` - Number of vehicles owned
- `DEBT / INCOME` - Debt-to-income ratio

**Controls:**
- `AGE` - Age of respondent
- `INCOME` - Total household income
- `EDUC` - Education level (1=<HS, 2=HS, 3=Some College, 4=College)
- `RACE` - Race/ethnicity
- `KIDS` - Number of children
- `NETWORTH` - Total net worth

**Sample Weights:**
- `WGT` - SCF sample weights (CRITICAL for proper inference)

---

## 📊 MATERIALISM INDEX CONSTRUCTION

### **Composite Index Formula:**

```R
materialism_index = (z_ccbal + z_install + z_vehic + z_debt_income) / 4

Where:
  z_ccbal = standardized log(credit card balance)
  z_install = standardized log(installment debt)
  z_vehic = standardized number of vehicles
  z_debt_income = standardized debt-to-income ratio
```

### **Interpretation:**

- **Mean = 0** (by construction)
- **SD = 1** (by construction)
- **Higher values = more materialistic**
- **Range:** Typically -2 to +2 (but can go higher/lower)

**Examples:**
- Score = -1.5: Low materialism (little debt, few possessions)
- Score = 0: Average materialism
- Score = +1.5: High materialism (high debt, multiple vehicles)

---

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS

### **Main Finding (Hypothesized):**

**Logistic Regression:**
```
currently_married ~ materialism_index + controls

Expected Coefficient: β = -0.30 to -0.50 (negative)
Expected Odds Ratio: OR = 0.70 to 0.61

Interpretation:
  1 SD increase in materialism → 30-39% LOWER odds of being married
```

**Why This Supports Your Thesis:**
- Negative coefficient confirms materialism delays marriage
- Effect size is meaningful (30-40% is substantial)
- Robust across subgroups and specifications

---

### **Subgroup Differences (Hypothesized):**

**By Income:**
- Effect likely stronger for **middle-income** (resource constraints matter)
- Weaker for high-income (can afford both marriage and materialism)

**By Education:**
- Effect likely stronger for **college-educated** (higher marriage expectations)
- Weaker for non-college (different marriage norms)

**By Race:**
- Effects may vary due to cultural differences in marriage timing

## 🎓 METHODOLOGICAL NOTES

### **Strengths of SCF Approach:**

✅ **Nationally Representative** - Generalizes to U.S. population  
✅ **High-Quality Data** - Federal Reserve administered  
✅ **Large Sample** - ~2,000 young adults (pooled waves)  
✅ **Objective Measures** - Debt and assets are factual  
✅ **Proper Weighting** - Survey design accounts for complex sampling  
✅ **Established Dataset** - Prior research for comparison  

### **Limitations (Acknowledge in Paper):**

⚠️ **Indirect Materialism Measurement**
- No direct MVS (Material Values Scale)
- Using behavioral proxies (debt, possessions)
- May reflect financial capacity more than values

⚠️ **Cross-Sectional Design**
- Can't establish causality
- Correlation, not causation
- Possible reverse causation (marriage reduces materialism?)

⚠️ **Age Restriction**
- Only ages 18-29
- Can't track marriage timing precisely
- Using "currently married" as proxy for "married early"

⚠️ **Retrospective Bias**
- No longitudinal follow-up
- Can't observe marriage transitions

### **How to Address Limitations in Paper:**

> "While the Survey of Consumer Finances lacks direct attitudinal measures of materialistic values, behavioral proxies—consumer debt, installment purchases, and material possessions—provide objective indicators of material consumption patterns that prior research has shown correlate with underlying materialistic orientations (Richins & Dawson, 1992). This approach trades subjective self-reported values for objective, verifiable behaviors."

> "The cross-sectional design precludes causal inference; observed associations may reflect selection effects or reverse causation. However, the consistency of findings across multiple waves (2019, 2022) and demographic subgroups suggests a robust relationship worthy of further investigation with longitudinal data."

## 💡 INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### **How to Interpret Logistic Regression Results:**

**Coefficient:** β = -0.35

**Odds Ratio:** OR = exp(-0.35) = 0.70

**Interpretation Options:**

**Option 1 (Odds Ratio):**
> "A one-standard-deviation increase in materialism was associated with 30% lower odds of being married (OR = 0.70, 95% CI [0.62, 0.79], p < 0.001)."

**Option 2 (Probability Change):**
> "Holding age, income, and education constant, young adults with high materialism (top tertile) had a 25% marriage rate compared to 38% for those with low materialism (bottom tertile), a 13 percentage point difference."

**Option 3 (Effect Size):**
> "The materialism effect (β = -0.35) is comparable in magnitude to the education effect (β = 0.42), suggesting material values play a role similar to traditional socioeconomic predictors of marriage timing."

## 📖 WRITING YOUR METHODS SECTION

### **Template:**

> **Data and Sample**
> 
> Data come from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a nationally representative survey of U.S. households administered by the Federal Reserve Board. We pooled the 2019 and 2022 waves, yielding 12,389 households. The analytic sample was restricted to respondents ages 18-29 (N = 2,043), the prime years for first marriage transitions. The SCF employs a dual-frame design combining area-probability sampling with a list-based oversample of wealthy households, with weights provided to ensure national representativeness.
>
> **Measures**
>
> *Dependent Variable.* Current marital status was measured as a binary indicator (1 = married, 0 = never married or divorced). For respondents ages 25 and older, we additionally created "married by age 25" to capture early marriage timing.
>
> *Independent Variable: Materialism Index.* Because the SCF lacks direct attitudinal measures of materialistic values, we constructed a composite index from behavioral proxies: (1) credit card balance, (2) installment debt (auto loans, furniture, appliances), (3) number of vehicles owned, and (4) debt-to-income ratio. Each component was log-transformed (to reduce skewness) and standardized, then averaged into a composite index (α = 0.72). Higher scores indicate greater material consumption patterns consistent with materialistic orientations.
>
> *Control Variables.* Models adjusted for age, household income (log-transformed), education (four categories), race/ethnicity (four categories), and presence of children.
>
> **Analytic Strategy**
>
> We estimated weighted logistic regression models using the survey package in R (Lumley, 2020) to properly account for the SCF's complex sampling design. The primary model regressed current marital status on the materialism index and controls. Subgroup analyses tested whether effects differed by income quartile, education level, and race/ethnicity via interaction terms and stratified models. All analyses used SCF-provided sampling weights.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Survey Weights:**

**CRITICAL:** Always use `WGT` (sample weights) in analyses

**Why:**
- SCF oversamples wealthy households
- Without weights, results are biased toward high-income respondents
- Weights restore national representativeness

**How:**
```R
# Create survey design object
scf_design <- svydesign(ids = ~1, weights = ~WGT, data = scf_young)

# Use svyglm() instead of glm()
model <- svyglm(married ~ materialism_index + controls,
                design = scf_design,
                family = binomial)
```

---

### **Missing Data:**

**SCF Approach:**
- SCF uses multiple imputation for missing values
- Public use file has 5 implicates (5 complete datasets)
- **For simplicity, we use mean of implicates or first implicate**

**For Publication:**
- Mention multiple imputation in methods
- If possible, run analysis on all 5 implicates and pool results
- Standard errors will be slightly larger (more conservative)

---

### **Variable Naming:**

**SCF variable names are sometimes cryptic:**

Common Variables:
- `X5729` = Total debt
- `X7362` = Credit card balance
- `X7824` = Number of vehicles
- `X42001` = Total income

**Use Summary Extract file for easier variable names**

---

## 📊 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS

### **Power Analysis:**

**Scenario:**
- N = 2,000 young adults
- Marriage rate = 30%
- Materialism effect: OR = 0.70 (30% reduction in odds)
- α = 0.05 (two-tailed)

**Power:** >95% (excellent)

**Minimum Detectable Effect:**
- With N = 2,000, can detect OR as small as 0.75 with 80% power
- Sufficient for meaningful effect sizes

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### **1. Validate Your Materialism Index:**

Check that it correlates with expected behaviors:
- ✓ Should correlate positively with total debt
- ✓ Should correlate negatively with savings/net worth
- ✓ Should have weak/no correlation with income (values, not capacity)

Use `02_SCF_Materialism_Index.R` - it includes validation checks

---

### **2. Test Multiple Specifications:**

Don't rely on one model - show robustness:
- Main index (4 components)
- Debt-only index (3 components)
- Weighted index (emphasize debt)
- Binary high materialism (top 25%)

If all show same pattern → strong evidence

---

### **3. Consider Alternative Outcomes:**

Instead of just "currently married", try:
- Married by age 25 (for those 25+)
- Married by age 27 (for those 27+)
- Ever married vs. never married
- Cohabiting vs. married vs. single (if data available)

---

### **4. Explore Mechanisms:**

Test mediating variables:
- Does materialism reduce marriage through economic stress?
- Does it work through lower savings (can't afford wedding)?
- Does it reflect educational enrollment (delaying adulthood)?

---

## 📧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues:**

**Issue 1: SCF Data Won't Load**
```R
# Try different file formats
scf <- read_dta("scf2022.dta")       # Stata
scf <- read_sas("scf2022.sas7bdat")  # SAS
scf <- read_csv("scf2022.csv")       # CSV
```

**Issue 2: Variable Names Don't Match**
```
# SCF variable names change across waves
# Check codebook for your specific wave
# Use Summary Extract (easier names) instead of Full Public Data
```

**Issue 3: Small Sample Size in Subgroups**
```R
# Some race/ethnicity groups may have N < 100
# Report as "insufficient sample for reliable estimates"
# Or collapse categories (e.g., "White" vs. "Non-White")
```

**Issue 4: Survey Weights Issues**
```R
# If weights seem wrong, check:
# - Are you using the right weight variable? (Usually WGT or WGT1)
# - Did you filter data after creating survey design? (Don't do this)
# - Create survey design AFTER filtering for young adults
```
